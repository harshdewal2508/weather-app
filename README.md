# Weather App

A simple weather application that displays current weather information for a city or location based on user input. This project is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** with data fetched from a weather API.

## Features

- Search for weather information by city name.
- Displays temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed.
- Responsive design that works across different devices.
- User-friendly interface.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5**: Markup for structuring the app.
- **CSS3**: Styling the user interface and providing responsive layouts.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Fetching data from the weather API and dynamically updating the DOM.

## How It Works

1. The user enters the name of a city into the input field.
2. Upon clicking the "Search" button, the app makes a request to a weather API (such as [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) or similar) to retrieve the current weather data.
3. The app displays the weather information, including temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind speed.
4. If the city is not found or there is an error with the API request, the app notifies the user with an error message.

## Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites

To use this app, you need to have basic knowledge of:
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Access to an API key from a weather service (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API).
